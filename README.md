# CS330-Final-Project

This project has helped me to develop 3D objects in a low level setting. With each item in my scene I thought of the different shapes needed to create the one object. I believe the tactics used in this project could be widely used in other projects. I followed a snowball method of attacking this project. I started with the easier objects first and moved to the harder more complex objects. Throughout this project I would constantly run the program to see how the different objects were positioned and how the lighting was effecting certain elements. I would tweak the code a little bit each time until I was satisfied with the final result. In this project iteration was huge with things constantly changing to try and create the "perfect" scene. This project really taught me that chasing perfection takes time and doesn't happen instantly, especially when it came to the lighting.
